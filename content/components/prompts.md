Generally speaking, prompts are the CLI’s version of forms.

- Use prompts for entering information
- Use a prompt when user intent is unclear
- Make sure to provide flags for all prompts


## Yes/No
Use for yes/no questions, usually a confirmation. The default (what will happen if you enter nothing and hit enter) is in caps.


```
? Prompt [y/N]
```


## Short text
Use to enter short strings of text. Enter will accept the auto fill if available

```
? Prompt (Auto fill)
```

## Long text
Use to enter large bodies of text. E key will open the user’s preferred editor, and Enter will skip.

```
? Prompt [(e) to launch vim, enter to skip]
```

## Radio select

```

Ability to skip confirmation via a flag
Open • AliabbasMerchant opened about 2 days ago • 1 comment



  #1330 proposes to add confirmation to risky commands. It is a nice feature to
  have, but in order to support proper scriptability, we should support a flag
  (preferably  -y , like in most CLIs), to skip asking for confirmation. So for
  each of the 4 commands mentioned there (and possibly even more in the future),
  we should add support for the  -y  flag

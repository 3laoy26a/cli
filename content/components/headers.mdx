When viewing output that could be unclear, headers can quickly set context for what youâ€™re seeing and where you are.

### Examples
<img src={Header} alt="An example of the header of the gh pr create command" />
<Caption>The header of the "gh pr create" command reassures the user that they're creating the correct pull request</Caption>

<img src={GhPrList} alt="An example of the header of the gh pr list command" />
<Caption>The header of the "gh pr list" command sets context for what list you're seeing</Caption>

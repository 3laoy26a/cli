While CLI does not have images, we do have unicode at our disposal to enhance meaning. When applying iconography consider:

- People use different fonts that will have varying unicode support
- Only use iconography to enhance meaning, not to communicate meaning
  - ref: https://primer.style/design/global/accessibility#visual-accessibility
  - Similar to using iconography in general!

Note: In Windows, Powershell’s default font (Lucida Console) has poor unicode support. Microsoft suggests changing it for more unicode support. Unclear their plans on changing this default

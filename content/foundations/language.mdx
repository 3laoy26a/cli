Language is the most important tool at our disposal for creating a clear, understandable product. Having clear language helps us create memorable commands that are clear in what they will do.

We generally follow this structure:

|gh|`<command>`|`<subcommand>`|[value]|[flags]|[value]|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|gh |issue|view|234|--web|-|
|gh|pr|create|-|--title|“Title”|
|gh|repo|fork|cli/cli|--clone|false|
|gh|pr|status|-|-|-|
|gh|issue|list|-|--state|closed|
|gh|pr|review|234|--approve|-|


**Command:** The object you want to interact with

**Subcommand:** The action you want to take on that object. Most `gh` commands contain a command and subcommand. These may take arguments, such as issue/PR numbers, URLs, file names, OWNER/REPO, etc.

**Flag:** A way to modify the command, also may be called “options”. You can use multiple flags. Flags can take values, but don’t always. Flags always have a long version with two dashes `(--state)` but often also have a shortcut with one dash and one letter `(-s)`. It’s possible to chain shorthand flags: `-sfv` is the same as `-s -f -v`

**Values:** Are passed to the commands or flags
- The most common command values are:
  - Issue or PR number
  - The “owner/repo” pair
  - URLs
  - Branch names
  - File names
- The possible flag values depend on the flag:
  - `--state` takes `{closed | open | merged}`
  - `--clone` is a boolean flag
  - `--title` takes a string
  - `--limit` takes an integer


_Tip: To get a better sense of what feels right, try writing out the commands in the CLI a few different ways._

<DoDontContainer>
  <Do src={Language06}>
    Use a flag for modifiers of actions
  </Do>
  <Dont src={Language03}>
    Avoid making modifiers their own commands
  </Dont>
</DoDontContainer>


**When designing your command’s language system:**
- Use [GitHub language](/getting-started/principles#make-it-feel-like-github)
- Use unambiguous language that can’t be confused for something else
- Use shorter phrases if possible and appropriate

<DoDontContainer>
  <Do src={Language05}>
    Use language that can't be misconstrued
  </Do>
  <Dont src={Language02}>
    Avoid language that can be interpreted in multiple ways ("open in browser" or "open a pull request" here)
  </Dont>
</DoDontContainer>

<DoDontContainer>
  <Do src={Language04}>
    Use understood shorthands to save characters to type
  </Do>
  <Dont src={Language01}>
    Avoid long words in commands if there's a reasonable alternative
  </Dont>
</DoDontContainer>

import Typography from '../../images/Typography.png'

Everything is a command line interface is text, so type hierarchy is important. All type is the same size and font, but you can still create type hierarchy using font weight and space.

<img src={Typography} alt="An example of normal weight, and bold weight. Italics is striked through since it's not used." />

People customize their fonts, but you can assume it will be a monospace
Monospace fonts inherently create visual order
Fonts may have variable unicode support

### Accessibility

If you want to ensure that a screen reader will read a pause, you can use a:
- period (`.`)
- comma (`,`)
- colon (`:`)

title: Typography
---

Everything is a command line interface is text, so type hierarchy is important. All type is the same size and font, but you can still create type hierarchy using font weight and space.

```
Regular weight
**Bold weight**
*~We canâ€™t reliably use italics~*
```

People customize their fonts, but you can assume it will be a monospace
Monospace fonts inherently create visual order
Fonts may have variable unicode support

### Accessibility

If you want to ensure that a screen reader will read a pause, you can use a:
- period `.`
- comma `,`
- line break
- colon `:`

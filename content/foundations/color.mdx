Terminals reliably recognize the 8 basic ANSI colors.


|Red|Green|Yellow|Magenta|Cyan|Blue|Black|White|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Error Closed Failing|Success Open|Pending Warning|Merged|Branches|-|-|-|




There are also bright versions of these colors, which we can also use, but less reliably.

Things to note
- Background color is available but we haven’t taken advantage of it yet
- Some terminals support 256 color not reliably
- People can customize their colors but that’s opt-in (the user knows they’re making their greens not green for example)
- Only use color to enhance meaning, not to communicate meaning

  - ex: issue list defaults to open so it’s ok there, on detail page we write open

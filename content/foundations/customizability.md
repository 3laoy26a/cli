title: Customizability
---

Be aware that people exist in different environments (shells, OS, terminals) and may customize their setups. Customizations include:
- Shell: shell prompt, shell aliases, PATH and other environment variables, tab-completion behavior
- Terminal: font, color scheme, and keyboard shortcuts
- OS: language input options, accessibility settings

The CLI itself is also customizable. These are all tools at your disposal when designing new commands.
- Aliasing: gh alias set
- Preferences: gh config set
- Environment variables: NO_COLOR, EDITOR, etc

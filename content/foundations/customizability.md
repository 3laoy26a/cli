title: Customizability
---

Be aware that people exist in different environments and may customize their setups. Customizations include:
- **Shell:** shell prompt, shell aliases, PATH and other environment variables, tab-completion behavior
- **Terminal:** font, color scheme, and keyboard shortcuts
- **Operating system**: language input options, accessibility settings

The CLI tool itself is also customizable. These are all tools at your disposal when designing new commands.
- Aliasing: `gh alias set`
- Preferences: `gh config set`
- Environment variables: `NO_COLOR`, `EDITOR`, etc

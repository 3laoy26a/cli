title: Principles
---

## Reasonable defaults, easy overrides
Optimize for what most people will need to do most of the time
But make it easy to change that

## Make it feel like GitHub
Use GitHubby language
https://brand.github.com/content/grammar
https://brand.github.com/content/terminology
- Examples
  - close vs delete
  - Sentence case
Match GitHub.com UI as closely as you can using the tools at your disposal

Reduce cognitive load
CLIs have very few affordances, rely on memory, and are often unforgiving of mistakes. How can we design our commands to best mitigate this?
Introducing a little friction to prevent mistakes
Anticipate what people might want to do next
Reducing cognitive load is important for making an accessible product
Considerations
How can we make it less scary to hit enter? How can we make it obvious what will happen when they hit enter?
How can we make it easier to remember commands?
How can we make it easier to navigate, know where you are, and what you need to do next?
Examples
Confirm steps
Headers
Command language
All commands should be parallel: gh X create is always the same
Option to delete branch after merging

Bias towards terminal, but make it easy to get to the browser
We want to keep people in the terminal wherever we can, but when itâ€™s necessary to jump to other tools make it very obvious, fast, and easy.
Lots of things might just be better to do in a GUI, but people will always ask for more than you expect
Examples
--web flags
outputting URLs
Preview in browser step
